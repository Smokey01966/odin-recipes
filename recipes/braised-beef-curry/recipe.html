   <p>In this Indian-inspired dish, chunks of beef cook in their own juices, seasoned with spices.</p>
   <p>Using whole spices such as cloves and coriander seeds and cinnamon sticks, rather than ground versions,</p>
   <p>improves the result since they release their flavor slowly as the curry cooks.</p>
   <p>Serve with lots of fluffy white rice and Indian bread such as naan to soak up the delicious sauce.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1 Tbsp. Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 lbs. Stewing beef, trimmed, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 Onions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>1 Cinnamon stick (approximately 2 inches long)</li>
    <li>4 Cloves</li>
    <li>1 tsp. Salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp. Pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. Fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Beef stock</li>
    <li>2 Long red or green chiles, finely chopped (see notes)</li>
   </ul> 
   <h2>Method</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>
        <p>In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat for 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Add beef, in batches, and cook, stirring, adding a bit more oil if necessary</p>
        <p>Until nicely browned, about 4 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to slow cooker</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium. Add onions to pan and cook, stirring until softened, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add garlic, ginger, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, salt, pepper, fennel seeds</p>
        <p>Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add stock and bring to a boil.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Pour mixture over beef cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or high for 4 to 5.</p>
        <p>When beef is tender stir in chiles then cover and cook on high for 10 minutes</p>
        <p>Serve immediately.</p>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Notes</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
        <p>Chile nomenclature can be confusing. Long red or green chiles are usually used in Indian cooking and can be found in asian markets.</p>
        <p>They are sometimes called cayenne or serrano chiles not to be confused with Mexican serrano chiles, which are different.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This dish can be partially prepared before it is cooked.</p>
        <p>Start with step 2 then cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.</p>
        <p>When you are ready to cook complete steps 1 and 3.</p>
