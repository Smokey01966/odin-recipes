                        In this Indian-inspired dish, chunks of beef cook in their own juices, seasoned with spices.
                        Using whole spices such as cloves and coriander seeds and cinnamon sticks, rather than ground versions,
                        improves the result since they release their flavor slowly as the curry cooks.
                        Serve with lots of fluffy white rice and Indian bread such as naan to soak up the delicious sauce.

                        Chile nomenclature can be confusing. Long red or green chiles are usually used in Indian cooking and can be found in asian markets.
                        They are sometimes called cayenne or serrano chiles not to be confused with Mexican serrano chiles, which are different.

                        This dish can be partially prepared before it is cooked.
                        Start with step 2 then cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
                        When you are ready to cook complete steps 1 and 3.
